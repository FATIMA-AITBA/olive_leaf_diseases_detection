# Deep Learning-Powered Web Application for Detecting Olive Leaf Diseases using TensorFlow

I developed a deep learning-based web application using Flask that automatically detects diseases in olive tree leaves through image analysis. Leveraging TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system was trained on a curated dataset of olive leaf images labeled with various disease categories and healthy samples.

Key features of the application include:

Image Classification: Real-time prediction of olive leaf health status by uploading an image.

Model Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy by optimizing the CNN architecture and applying data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

User-Friendly Interface: Built a responsive and intuitive web interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS, allowing users (farmers/agronomists) to upload leaf images and instantly receive diagnostic results.

Product Recommendation: Integrated a recommendation phase that suggests suitable agricultural products or treatments for each identified disease, helping users take prompt and effective action.

This project aims to support precision agriculture by enabling early detection of leaf diseases and providing actionable recommendations, ultimately improving crop yield and plant health.
